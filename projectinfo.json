We implemented the Identity-by-State python (IBSpy: https://github.com/Uauy-Lab/IBSpy) pipeline and used it to identify T. monococcum introgressions in the ten hexaploid wheat pangenome cultivars. We used IBSpy and k-mer databases from multiple genotypes, including the Illumina raw data (~10-fold) of 218 T. monococcum accessions, two T. monococcum chromosome-scale assemblies, and ten genome assemblies of wheat (Walkowiak et al., 2020). We counted variations using 50-kbp windows. For details about how IBSpy detects variations, please, read the documentation. To estimate the variations cut-off and sequence identity to detect T. monococcum introgressions, we compared the published pairwise MUMmer alignments (Brinton et al., 2020) of the ten pangenome cultivars (ArinaLrFor, Chinese Spring, Jagger, Julius, LongReach Lancer, CDC Landmark, Mace, Norin 61, Stanley, SY_Mattis) and the two T. monococcum assemblies generated here (TA299 and TA10622) with the corresponding variations counts from IBSpy. In total, there were 110 pairwise alignments analyzed, and we focused on the seven A genome chromosomes.",

A breeding scheme that propagated advanced backcrossed populations of wheat-T. timopheevii introgression lines through further backcrossing and self-fertilisation resulted in the generation of 99 introgression lines (ILs) that carried 309 homozygous segments from the A and G subgenomes of T. timopheevii. These homozygous introgressions were detected through the development of a set of 480 chromosome-specific Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers that are well-distributed across the wheat genome. Of these, 149 were developed in this study based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered through whole genome sequencing of T. timopheevii. Together these homozygous wheat-T. timopheevii ILs and chromosome-specific KASP markers provide an invaluable resource to wheat breeders for trait discovery to combat biotic and abiotic stress factors brought upon wheat production due to climate change.",

		"projectName": "Integrating genomic resources to present full gene and promoter capture probe sets for bread wheat",
		"description": "Whole genome shotgun re-sequencing of wheat is expensive because of its large, repetitive genome. Moreover, sequence data can fail to map uniquely to the reference genome making it difficult to unambiguously assign variation. Re-sequencing using target capture enables sequencing of large numbers of individuals at high coverage to reliably identify variants associated with important agronomic traits. We present two gold standard capture probe sets for hexaploid bread wheat, a gene and a promoter capture, which are designed using recently developed genome sequence and annotation resources. The captures can be combined or used independently. The capture probe sets effectively enrich the high confidence genes and promoters that were identified in the genome alongside a large proportion of the low confidence genes and promoters. We use a capture design employing an 'island strategy' to enable analysis of the large gene/promoter space of wheat with only 2x160 Mb NimbelGen probe sets. Furthermore, these assays extend the regions of the wheat genome that are amenable to analyses beyond its exome, providing tools for detailed characterization of these regulatory regions in large populations. Here, we release the targeted sequence of the capture probe sets on the wheat RefSeqv1, the design space that was used to tile our capture probes across and finally the positions of the probes themselves across this design space for both the gene and promoter capture probe sets.

		"description": "Despite its large genome size, high DNA repetitive content and similarity between homoeologous chromosomes, hexaploid wheat completes meiosis in a shorter period than diploid species with a much smaller genome. Therefore, during wheat meiosis, mechanisms additional to the classical model based on DNA sequence homology, must facilitate more efficient homologous recognition. One such mechanism could involve exploitation of differences in chromosome structure between homologs and homoeologs at the onset of meiosis. In turn, these chromatin changes can be expected to be linked to transcriptional gene activity. In this study, we present an extensive analysis of a large RNA-seq data derived from 6 different genotypes: wheat, wheat-rye hybrids and newly synthesized octoploid triticale, both in the presence and absence of the Ph1 locus. Plant material was collected at early prophase, at the transition leptotene-zygotene, when the six genotypes exhibit different levels of synapsis and chromatin structure. Unexpectedly, our study reveals that neither synapsis, whole genome duplication nor the absence of the Ph1 locus are associated with major changes in gene expression levels during early meiotic prophase. Overall wheat transcription at this meiotic stage is therefore highly resilient to such alterations, even in the presence of major chromatin structural changes. Our knowledge of the genes involved in meiosis in many crop species such as wheat is largely based on studies on model species. Here we used the WGCNA package in R to build a meiotic gene co-expression network in wheat based on 130 wheat RNA-seq samples collected from a range of tissues including meiotic anthers. A set of 50,387 genes were expressed during meiosis and assigned to 66 modules according to their expression patterns. Three of the modules (modules 2, 28 and 41 containing 4940 genes, 544 genes and 313 genes, respectively) were significantly correlated with meiotic tissue samples but not with any other type of tissue. The three meiosis-related modules were highly enriched with GO terms related to cell cycle, DNA replication, chromatin modifications and other processes occurring during meiosis. Wheat orthologs of meiosis genes were found in modules 2, 28 and 41. Module 2, in particular, was significantly enriched possessing 166 meiosis orthologs. The combination of co-expression network analysis in tandem with orthologue information will contribute to enhance wheat meiotic studies, which will lead to better understanding of the regulation of meiosis in wheat (and other polyploid plants) and subsequently improve wheat production.

		"description": "The coordinated expression of highly related homoeologous genes in polyploid species underlies the phenotypes of many of the world?s major crops. However, the balance of homoeolog expression across diverse tissues, stress conditions, and cultivars remains poorly understood. Here we combine extensive gene expression datasets with the fully annotated genome sequence to produce a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of homoeolog expression patterns in hexaploid bread wheat. Bias in homoeolog expression varied between tissues, with ~30% of wheat homoeologs showing unbalanced expression. We found expression asymmetries along wheat chromosomes, with genes showing the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation most often located in the high-recombination distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic genes potentially represent the first steps towards neo/sub- functionalization of wheat homoeologs. Co-expression networks revealed extensive coordination of homoeologs throughout development and, alongside a detailed expression atlas, provide a framework to target candidate genes underpinning agronomic traits in polyploid wheat.
